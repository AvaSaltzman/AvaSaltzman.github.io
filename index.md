### CPSC 120

* Lab 4 part-1

    Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite because it was interesting learning how to
    convert different measurements. While at the same time used several different
    classes in order to oganize them. Specifically this lab used several tricks
    like creating classes and different functions that help convert.

* Lab 6 part-1

    In lab 6, part 1 was a good lab because it was the use of vectors and how they
    are used when it contains a certain number you want. Vectors are very useful 
    in storing multiple information at once. However, they could only all be certain
    data type.

* Lab 8 part-1

    Lab 8, part 1 consisted of vectors, if statements, and stod, it allowed to add 
    int vectors together in order to get an average for all the ints in the vector. 
    Also in lab 8, the code uses lots of memeber functions and use with the vector. 
    The lab helped me learn more about how to use vectors and how to apply it to 
    member functions.
